Run Program v1.0 RC 1

Run Program is just a simple little app for running a quick Terminal command inspired by Run... by Luke A. Kanies. In addition to being open source, it also completes commands as you type. This includes Tracker, Preferences apps, all regular Terminal commands, and regular apps, too. When bound to a key combination via SpicyKeys, this app saves quite a bit of time.

About this version

This version includes fixes by looncraz to fix crashing on certain systems, such as Dano machines, and some other internal tweaks. Autocompletion is now not case-sensitive, so finding the program you want is now even easier.

Please e-mail me if you find any bugs.
